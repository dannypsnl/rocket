## commit types

- feat: complete the feature
- add: new code but don't complete feature yet
- fix: for any fix for product code(!fix test is not in scope)
- test: for any change about test
- refactor: no break through change but just improving code
- style: something important but not about code like comment
- doc: change about document like README(!GoDoc also in this scope, even if it's comments)

## commit rule

- Nice to use `git commit -s`
- Must add commit type
- If can, reference to the issue by format `(#issue)commit-type: commit-title`
