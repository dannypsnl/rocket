Your nice place for learning rocket framework.

- [hello](./main.go), run it up and open `localhost:8080/hello/<yourname>/<yourage>` to get first response!
- [upload picture](./upload-picture/main.go), run it up and open `localhost:8080` to upload your lovely picture.
- [work with orm](./gorm/main.go), run it and open `localhost:8080/user/<yourname>/<yourage>` to feel DB!
- [login system](./login-system/main.go), run it and open `localhost:8080`, enter username and password to login! There are two username/password pair allowed.

  1. username: `aaa`, password: `aaa`
  2. username: `bbb`, password: `bbb`

  Others pair shouldn't let you logged in, but keep requiring you back to home page.
